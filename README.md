IPhone 6 – £300<br>
Iphone 5 - £200<br>
Ipad - £500<br>
Mackbook air - £1000<br>
Macbook pro - £2000<br>

It offers following discounts<br>
5% off if you buy 2 iphone 6 –“Iphone 6 Discount”<br>
10% off if its customers birthday on the day of ordering any product. – “Birthday Discount”<br>
15% off if customer is more than 50 years old  - “Senior Citizen Discount”<br>
20% off if order total is more than £3000 – “High Value Order Discount”<br>

It runs 2 different discount schemes,<br>

Single highest Discount – this means when this scheme is running, one customer can only get one of the discounts even if they are eligible for multiple discounts, for example if customer is 52 years old on day of ordering and also its his/her birthday on day of ordering, even though the customer is eligible for 2 discounts the highest is “senior citizen discount”. So this is the discount the system should apply to final order total.<br>

Multiple Discounts – This means that when this scheme is running a customer if eligible for more than one discount, will get more than one discount. For example in the same scenario as above, when this scheme is running the total discount is “Birthday Discount” + “Senior Citizen Discount” so total is 25% off the total order value.<br>
